"""R17. The coverage claim is checked in both directions, because each catches a lie.

The inventory says which SRD v5.2.1 effect shapes exist and which this engine resolves.
`ENGINE_SHAPES` says what the engine actually resolves. Left unchecked, the two drift in
opposite ways and both drifts read as success:

* The inventory marks a shape implemented that the engine cannot resolve — coverage is
  overstated, which is the failure R17 is written to prevent.
* The engine resolves a shape the inventory never lists — the denominator is wrong, so
  the percentage is meaningless even though every number in it is real.

A test that checked one direction would pass through the other.
